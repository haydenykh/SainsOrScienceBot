## How to contribute?

If you are willing to contribute to this repository/project, head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/haydenykh/SainsOrScienceBot/issues).

1. Click on the "**New issue**" button. In there, you will find two spaces that you can fill in.

2. For the **title**, you can put anything you want such as **New question**, **\<A random error\>**, etc.

3. For the **description** box, put in what you would like to add.
    - For instance, you'd like to add new questions to the bot.
        - In there, put on **3** things.
            1. First, **the question**, either in Malay (Bahasa Melayu) or English or both.
            2. Second, **the choices** & **the answer** for it. Third, **the question type**. The question type can be **[`objective`](#objective-type)**, **[`structural_write`](#structural-write-type)**, **[`structural_fitb`](#structural-fitb-type)** or **[`structural_tick`](#structural-tick-type)**.
            3. You can also provide an **image**. Note that it must be in **`png`** or **`jpg`** format
            4. **Hints** are also accepted if you have one. If not, one **might be** provided.

> If you were to **upload an image**, please do use an **image enhancer** such as **CamScanner** to **further brighten the image**.

4. You can also assign **labels** such as `feature`, `bug`, etc. You can leave it blank as contributors or the owner will assign it themselves.

5. Then you can **submit** it!

6. If your issue was **accepted**, **your username** will be added to the **credits section** of the **question embed**.

### Objective type

The objective type is a type with multiple choices with its respective answer in alphabetical order (A, B, C & D).

Example:

<ins>Plant cells has many characteristics in it. Name one of the characteristics.</ins>

_A. Doesn't have a cell wall._

_B. Has more than one nucleus._

**C. Has a fixed shape.**

_D. Doesn't have a chloroplast._

### Structural Write type

The structural write type is a type where you have to write points/answers in short form. Also, split them with commas and don't write answers in sentence form.

Example:

<ins>What are the characteristics of an asteroid?</ins>

-   **Size starts from 1 m to 1000 km**
-   **Made up of stones and metals**
-   **Has a cold surface temperature, approximately -73°C**
-   **Travel around the Sun at an average speed of $\textbf{25 km s}^{-1}$**
-   _Travels at varying speed_

### Structural FITB type

The structural FITB (fill in the blanks) type is a type where you have to fill in the blanks of an incomplete statement.

Example:

1. Exothermic reactions \_<ins>**releases heat**</ins>\_ to the environment.
2. \_<ins>**Granules**</ins>\_ is a phenomenon that occurs on the surface of the Sun due to the plasma convective current in the convection zone.
3. Henri Becquerel discovered \_<ins>**radioactivity**</ins>\_ when he discovered \_<ins>**uranium salts**</ins>\_ could darken \_<ins>**photo plates**</ins>\_ in 1896.
4. The pulmonary vein carries \_<ins>**deoxygenated**</ins>\_ blood from the \_<ins>**right ventricle**</ins>\_ to the lungs.
5. The corona layer is the Sun's \_<ins>**outermost**</ins>\_ layer and extends millions of kilometres into outer space.

### Structural Tick type

The structural tick type gives a statement and you have to tell whether it's true or false.
