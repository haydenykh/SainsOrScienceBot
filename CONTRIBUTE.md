# Contribution

## How to contribute?

If you are willing to contribute this repository/project, head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/haydenykh/SainsOrScienceBot/issues).

Click on the "**New issue**" button. In there, you will find two spaces that you can fill in.

For the **title**, you can put anything you want such as **New question**, **\<A random error\>**, etc.

For the **description** box, put in what you would like to add. For instance, you want to add new questions to the bot. In there, put on **3** things. First, **the question**, either BM or BI. Second, **the choices** & **the answer** for it. Third, **the question type**. The question type can be [`objective`](#objective-type), [`structural_write`](#structural-write-type), [`structural_fitb`](#structural-fitb-type) or [`structural_tick`](#structural-tick-type). You can also provide an image (must be in `png` or `jpg` format) and a hint.

You can also assign labels such as `feature`, `bug`, etc. You can leave it blank as contributors or the owner will assign it themselves.

Then you can submit it!

### Objective type

The objective type is choices with its respective answers in alphabetical order.

Example:

<ins>What is the characteristics of a plant cell?</ins>

_A. Doesn't have a cell wall._

_B. Has more than one nucleus._

**C. Has a fixed shape.**

_D. Doesn't have a chloroplast._

_E. …_

### Structural Write type

The structural write type is a type where you have to write points/answers in short form. Also, split them with commas and don't write answers in sentence form.

Example:

<ins>What are the characteristics of an asteroid?</ins>

-   **Size starts from 1 m to 1000 km**
-   **Made up of stones and metals**
-   **Has a cold surface temperature, approximately -73°C**
-   _Travels at varying speed_

### Structural FITB type

The structural FITB (fill in the blanks) type is a type where you have to fill in the blanks of an uncompleted statement.

Example:

1. Exothermic reactions \_<ins>**releases heat**</ins>\_ to the environment.
2. \_<ins>**Granules**</ins>\_ is a phenomenon that occurs on the surface of the Sun due to the plasma convective current in the convection zone.
3. Henri Becquerel discovered \_<ins>**radioactivity**</ins>\_ when he discovered \_<ins>**uranium salts**</ins>\_ could darken \_<ins>**photo plates**</ins>\_ in 1896.

### Structural Tick type

The structural tick type is a type where it gives a statement you have to tell whether its true or false.

Example:

1. Down syndrome has extra chromosome in chromosome number 21. ( ✓ )
2. Healthy manoeuvre is caused by drowning, lightning strike and electric shock. ( ✗ )
3. The general formula for alkane hydrocarbon is $\text{C}\_{n}\text{H}\_{2n+2}$. ( True )
4. The size of a fungi microorganism is $0.2 \mu \text{m}$ to $10 \mu \text{m}$. ( False )
