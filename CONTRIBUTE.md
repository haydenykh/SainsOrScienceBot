## How to contribute?

If you are willing to contribute this repository/project, head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/haydenykh/SainsOrScienceBot/issues).

Click on the "**New issue**" button. In there, you will find two spaces that you can fill in.

For the **title**, you can put anything you want such as **New question**, **\<a random error\>**, etc.

For the **description** box, put in what you would like to add. For instance, you want to add new questions to the bot. In there, put on **3** things. First, **the question**, either BM or BI. Second, **the choices** & **the answer** for it. Third, **the question type**. The question type can be [`objective`](#objective-type), [`structural_write`](#structural_write-type), [`structural_fitb`](#structural_fitb-type) or [`structural_tick`](#structural_tick-type). You can also provide an image (must be in `png` or `jpg` format) and a hint.

### Objective type {#objective-type}

The objective type is choices with its respective answers in alphabetical order.

Example:

What is the characteristics of the plant cell?

A. Doesn't have cell wall.

B. Has more than one nucleus.

**C. Has a fixed shape.**

D. Doesn't have chloroplast

E. …

### Structural Write type {#structural_write-type}

The structural write type is a type where you have to write points/answers in short form. Also, split them with commas and don't write answers in sentence form.

Example:

What are the characteristics of an asteroid?

-   **Size starts from 1 m to 1000 km**
-   **Made up of stones and metals**
-   **Has a cold surface temperature, approximately -73°C**
-   Travels at varying speed

### Structural FITB type {#structural_fitb-type}

The structural fitb (fill in the blanks) type is a type where you have to fill in the blanks of a statement.

Example:

1. Exothermic reactions \_<u>**releases heat**</u>\_ to the environment.
2. \_<u>**Granules**</u>\_ is a phenomenon that occurs on the surface of the Sun due to the plasma convective current in the convection zone.
3. Henri Becquerel discovered \_<u>**radioactivity**</u>\_ when he discovered \_<u>**uranium salts**</u>\_ could darken \_<u>**photo plates**</u>\_ in 1896.

### Structural Tick type {#structural_tick-type}

The structural tick type is a type where it gives a statement you have to tell whether its true or false.

Example.

1. Down syndrome has extra chromosome in chromosome number 21. ( ✓ )
2. Healthy manoeuvre is caused by drowning, lightning strike and electric shock. ( ✗ )
3. The general formula for alkane hydrocarbon is $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}$. ( True )
4. The size of a fungi microorganism is $0.2 \mu \text{m}$ to $10 \mu \text{m}$. ( False )
