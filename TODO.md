# TODO List

## Work In Progress

1. **Random Question Command Rework**

    : The random question command now uses a `json` file full of everything which is a big mess. Therefore, a rework is necessary. It will separate the questions into multiple different files with each question being its file. New classes, enums and interfaces will also be added to ease out the process of creating new questions.

    > Objective have just been finished and structural types are still work in progress.

## Todo

1. **Notes**

    : Notes are fundamental to people who are struggling with understanding the topic of the subject. Notes simplify the syllabus of your current level. They are also essential for people to search for information with ease without have to look through paragraphs of text that are all together.

2. **Help Command**

    : A help command can help users to navigate through the list of commands available on the bot. It creates an embed with the title as the category and commands listed as different fields. It also consists of a drop-down menu to display the categories.

> **PS:** These are all subject to change.
